<p> Notes: I tried to make the cat chases mouse game. The goal was that <p>the cat would
just appear wherever the mouse moved, and then disappeared when the mouse <p>moved again,
but it wasn't working. Right now it just appears when you click down, and<p> then
disappears when you leave that spot. I don't want to turn it in two days <p>late so I am
just doing it as it is.
